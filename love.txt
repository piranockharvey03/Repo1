I always watche my lecturer execute git commands for his side hustle as a full stack developer
and i always wanted to do that 
guess what?
we made it 
i made my first local repo and remote repo on git hub alwaysand now i can execute the 
commands too
he told me it just needs time
and when i put in time 
it worked

if you feel like you love it then dont thnk just start.
