In my second year at University
I always watched my lecturer execute git commands for his side hustle as a full stack developer
and i always wanted to do whatever he was doing
i basically knew what he did in mind but the how to excute the commands and from where 
and most of all why to excute the commands(the reason for commadn excecution) 
so i got to youtube, found a guy called Navin (Telusko)
and he taught me how to do it
guess what?
we made it 
i made my first local repo and remote repo on git hub and now i can execute the 
commands too
my lecuter told me told me it just needs time
and when i put in time 
it worked

if you feel like you love it then dont think twice just start.
coz the fact that you love is enough proof that you are ready to put in the work

START START START
